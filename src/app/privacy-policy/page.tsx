        <h2>Information we handle</h2>
        <p>

          <li>
            Institution and academic information, such as courses, departments,
            enrollments, class details, and related records.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment records such as amount, currency, status, payment provider,

        <h2>How information is used</h2>
        <p>
          Information is used to create and manage accounts, provide learning
          and institution features, associate users with their institution,
          process and record payments, protect the service, and respond to
          support or account requests.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Sign-in and payment providers</h2>
        <p>
          If you choose Google sign-in, Google handles its authentication
          process and provides account information needed to sign you in.
          Payments are handled by the payment provider selected during
          checkout. Their own privacy policies and terms also apply to the
          information they process. Edu-Matrix receives payment status and
          transaction details needed to maintain your payment history.
