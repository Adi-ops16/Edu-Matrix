        <h2>Using Edu-Matrix</h2>
        <p>
          Edu-Matrix provides tools for learning and institution management.
          Your access to features depends on your account, role, and
          institution. You agree to use the platform only for lawful purposes
          and in accordance with these terms and any applicable institution
          rules.

      <section>
        <h2>Your account</h2>
        <p>
          Keep your sign-in credentials secure and provide accurate information
          when creating or maintaining an account. You are responsible for
          activity carried out through your account. Notify your institution
          administrator if you believe your account has been accessed without
          permission.
        </p>

          <li>
            Attempt to access accounts, records, or areas you are not authorized
            to use.
          </li>

      <section>
        <h2>Institution content and permissions</h2>
        <p>
          You retain responsibility for content you submit. You confirm that
          you have the rights and permissions needed to provide it. You give
          Edu-Matrix permission to host and display that content only as needed
          to operate the platform and make its features available to authorized
          users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Where a course or feature requires payment, the applicable amount and
          currency are presented during checkout. Payment processing is
          provided by the selected third-party payment provider and is subject
          to that provider&apos;s terms. Edu-Matrix records payment status and
          transaction details. Questions about a charge or refund should be
          directed to the institution or payment provider responsible for it.

        <h2>Availability and changes</h2>
        <p>
          Features may change over time, and the platform may occasionally be
          unavailable for maintenance or other reasons. We do not guarantee
          uninterrupted availability. We may update these terms when the
          service or its requirements change; the current version will be
          published on this page.

          Access may be restricted or suspended when necessary to protect the
          platform, its users, or an institution, or when these terms are
          violated. Contact your institution administrator about account access
          or role-related decisions.
